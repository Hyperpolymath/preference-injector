## Governance Model

### Decision-Making Process

1. **Consensus First**: Aim for agreement, not voting
2. **Lazy Consensus**: Silence = agreement after 72 hours
3. **Voting**: When consensus fails, simple majority of Perimeter 1
4. **Veto Power**: Any Perimeter 1 can veto security/legal concerns (must provide alternative)

### Decision Types

| Decision Type | Who Decides | Process |
|---------------|-------------|---------|
| Bug fixes | Any contributor | Submit PR, get review |
| Small features | Perimeter 2+ | PR review, lazy consensus |
| Breaking changes | Perimeter 1 | Formal proposal, vote |
| Security issues | Perimeter 1 | Private triage, emergency powers |
| Code of Conduct | Perimeter 1 | Investigation, enforcement |
| Roadmap | Perimeter 1 | Community input, consensus |

### Emergency Powers

In case of:
- **Security breach**: Any Perimeter 1 can immediately revert commits
- **Legal threat**: Any Perimeter 1 can temporarily disable features
- **Harassment**: Any Perimeter 1 can immediately ban users

Post-emergency review required within 7 days.

## Conflict Resolution

### Technical Disagreements

1. **Discussion**: Open GitHub discussion, invite community input
2. **Prototyping**: Build competing implementations, compare objectively
3. **Mediation**: Third-party Perimeter 1 member arbitrates
4. **Vote**: If still deadlocked, simple majority of Perimeter 1

### Interpersonal Conflicts

1. **Private resolution**: Attempt 1-on-1 discussion first

3. **Enforcement**: Follow CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md escalation ladder
