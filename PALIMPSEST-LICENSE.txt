Palimpsest License v0.8
========================

Copyright (c) 2024 Hyperpolymath and Contributors

PREAMBLE

The Palimpsest License is a copyleft license designed to ensure that software
remains free and that derivative works preserve freedom while respecting the
layered nature of software development. Like a palimpsest (a manuscript page
that has been written on multiple times, with earlier text showing through),
this license acknowledges that software is built in layers, with each
contribution adding to and modifying what came before.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

1. DEFINITIONS

   "Original Work" refers to the software distributed under this License.

   "Derivative Work" refers to any work based upon the Original Work,
   including but not limited to modifications, translations, adaptations,
   and works that incorporate all or part of the Original Work.

   "Layer" refers to a distinct contribution or modification to the software,
   which may coexist with previous layers while adding new functionality.

   "You" (or "Your") refers to an individual or legal entity exercising
   permissions granted by this License.

   "Source Code" means the preferred form for making modifications to the work.

2. GRANT OF COPYRIGHT LICENSE

   Subject to the terms of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You
   a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   copyright license to:

   a) Use the Original Work
   b) Reproduce the Original Work
   c) Prepare Derivative Works
   d) Publicly display the Original Work
   e) Publicly perform the Original Work
   f) Distribute copies of the Original Work

3. GRANT OF PATENT LICENSE

   Each Contributor grants You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
   royalty-free, irrevocable patent license to make, have made, use, offer to
   sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Original Work.

4. ATTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS

   a) You must retain all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices
      from the Source Code in any Derivative Works You create.

   b) You must include a prominent notice stating that You modified the files,
      including the date of modification.

   c) You must preserve the "layer structure" by maintaining a CHANGELOG or
      similar documentation that tracks modifications across versions and
      contributors.

5. COPYLEFT PROVISIONS

   a) Any Derivative Work must be distributed under the terms of this License
      or a compatible copyleft license (such as GPL v3+, AGPL v3+, or EPL 2.0).

   b) You must make the Source Code of any Derivative Work You distribute
      available under this License.

   c) If You distribute the Original Work or Derivative Works, You must include
      a copy of this License and make clear that recipients have the rights
      granted by this License.

6. PALIMPSEST PRINCIPLE

   In recognition that software is built in layers:

   a) You may add new "layers" (features, modules, extensions) to the software
      without modifying existing layers, provided that:
      - The new layer is clearly documented as separate
      - The original layers remain accessible and functional
      - The combined work is distributed under this License

   b) When modifying existing layers, you must:
      - Document what was changed and why
      - Preserve backward compatibility where reasonably possible
      - Maintain the ability for users to access or restore previous layers

7. NETWORK USE PROVISION (Affero-like)

   If You run a modified version of the Original Work on a server and allow
   users to interact with it remotely through a network, You must provide
   those users with access to the Source Code of Your modified version.

8. COMPATIBILITY WITH OTHER LICENSES

   This License is designed to be compatible with:
   - GNU General Public License v3.0 or later
   - GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 or later
   - Eclipse Public License 2.0
   - Mozilla Public License 2.0

   You may redistribute works under this License under the terms of these
   compatible licenses.

9. TIVOIZATION PREVENTION

   You may not use technical measures to prevent users from running modified
   versions of the software on hardware that normally runs the Original Work.
   Installation information must be provided if technically feasible.

10. NO WARRANTY

    THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
    IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE
    AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER
    LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING
    FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER
    DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

    IN NO EVENT WILL ANY CONTRIBUTOR BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY DAMAGES, INCLUDING
    ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
    USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF SUCH CONTRIBUTOR HAS BEEN
    ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

12. TERMINATION

    This License is effective until terminated. Your rights under this License
    will terminate automatically without notice if You fail to comply with any
    of its terms. Upon termination, You must destroy all copies of the Original
    Work and Derivative Works in Your possession or control.

    However, if You cure the violation within 30 days of becoming aware of it,
    Your rights are automatically reinstated.

13. ETHICAL USE CLAUSE

    You may not use the Original Work for purposes that:
    a) Violate human rights as defined by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
    b) Facilitate surveillance or oppression
    c) Contribute to environmental destruction
    d) Support military applications designed to harm civilians

    This clause may be waived for specific uses with written permission from the
    original copyright holders.

14. REVISION AND VERSIONING

    The Palimpsest License may be revised from time to time. Each version will
    be given a distinguishing version number. You may distribute the Original
    Work under the terms of the version of the License under which You received
    it, or any later version.

15. MISCELLANEOUS

    This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
    hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
    provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.

    This License shall be governed by the laws of the jurisdiction where the
    Original Work was first published, without regard to conflict of law provisions.
